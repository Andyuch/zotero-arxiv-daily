| SENDER | ✅ | str | The email account of the SMTP server that sends you email. | abc@qq.com |
| SENDER_PASSWORD | ✅ | str | The password of the sender account. Note that it's not necessarily the password for logging in the e-mail client, but the authentication code for SMTP service. Ask your email provider for this.   | abcdefghijklmn |
| RECEIVER | ✅ | str | The e-mail address that receives the paper list. | abc@outlook.com |
| MAX_PAPER_NUM | | int | The maximum number of the papers presented in the email. This value directly affects the execution time of this workflow, because it takes about 70s to generate TL;DR for one paper. `-1` means to present all the papers retrieved. | 50 |
| SEND_EMPTY | | bool | Whether to send an empty email even if no new papers today. | False |
| USE_LLM_API | | bool | Whether to use the LLM API in the cloud or to use local LLM. If set to `1`, the API is used. Else if set to `0`, the workflow will download and deploy an open-source LLM. Default to `0`. | 0 |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | | str | API Key when using the API to access LLMs. You can get FREE API for using advanced open source LLMs in [SiliconFlow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/b3XhBRAm). | sk-xxx |

There are also some public variables (Repository Variables) you can set, which are easy to edit.
![vars](./assets/repo_var.png)

| Key | Required | Type | Description | Example |
| :--- | :---  | :---  | :--- | :--- |
| ZOTERO_IGNORE | | str | Gitignore-style patterns marking the Zotero collections that should be ignored. One rule one line. Learn more about [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore). | AI Agent/<br>**/survey<br>!LLM/survey |
| REPOSITORY | | str | The repository that provides the workflow. If set, the value can only be `TideDra/zotero-arxiv-daily`, in which case, the workflow always pulls the latest code from this upstream repo, so that you don't need to sync your forked repo upon each update, unless the workflow file is changed. | `TideDra/zotero-arxiv-daily` |
| REF | | str | The specified ref of the workflow to run. Only valid when REPOSITORY is set to `TideDra/zotero-arxiv-daily`. Currently supported values include `main` for stable version, `dev` for development version which has new features and potential bugs. | `main` |
| LANGUAGE | | str | The language of TLDR; Its value is directly embeded in the prompt passed to LLM | Chinese |

That's all! Now you can test the workflow by manually triggering it:
![test](./assets/test.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The Test-Workflow Action is the debug version of the main workflow (Send-emails-daily), which always retrieve 5 arxiv papers regardless of the date. While the main workflow will be automatically triggered everyday and retrieve new papers released yesterday. There is no new arxiv paper at weekends and holiday, in which case you may see "No new papers found" in the log of main workflow.

Then check the log and the receiver email after it finishes.

By default, the main workflow runs on 22:00 UTC everyday. You can change this time by editting the workflow config `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

### Local Running
Supported by [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), this workflow can easily run on your local device if uv is installed:
```bash
# set all the environment variables
# export ZOTERO_ID=xxxx
# ...
cd zotero-arxiv-daily
uv run main.py
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The workflow will download and run an LLM (Qwen2.5-3B, the file size of which is about 3G). Make sure your network and hardware can handle it.

> [!WARNING]
> Other package managers like pip or conda are not tested. You can still use them to install this workflow because there is a `pyproject.toml`, while potential problems exist.

## 🚀 Sync with the latest version

## 📖 How it works
*Zotero-arXiv-Daily* firstly retrieves all the papers in your Zotero library and all the papers released in the previous day, via corresponding API. Then it calculates the embedding of each paper's abstract via an embedding model. The score of a paper is its weighted average similarity over all your Zotero papers (newer paper added to the library has higher weight).

The TLDR of each paper is generated by a lightweight LLM (Qwen2.5-3b-instruct-q4_k_m), given its title, abstract, introduction, and conclusion (if any). The introduction and conclusion are extracted from the source latex file of the paper.

## 📌 Limitations
- The recommendation algorithm is very simple, it may not accurately reflect your interest. Welcome better ideas for improving the algorithm!
- This workflow deploys an LLM on the cpu of Github Action runner, and it takes about 70s to generate a TLDR for one paper. High `MAX_PAPER_NUM` can lead the execution time exceed the limitation of Github Action runner (6h per execution for public repo, and 2000 mins per month for private repo). Commonly, the quota given to public repo is definitely enough for individual use. If you have special requirements, you can deploy the workflow in your own server, or use a self-hosted Github Action runner, or pay for the exceeded execution time.

## V3 daily freshness and repeat recommendations

V3 aligns journal intake to the same **daily clock as arXiv** instead of using
an overlapping 3-day Crossref pool. The logical literature day remains
**20:00 ET → 20:00 ET**, but the Crossref `created-date` retrieval window is
widened by two hours on each side: **18:00 ET → 22:00 ET**. Consecutive runs
therefore overlap for only four hours around the arXiv boundary.

The overlap is retrieval-only. Every Crossref DOI/normalized-title identity that
has been successfully processed is persisted in
`SITE_OUTPUT_DIR/data/crossref-ingestion-history.json`. Records already present
in that ingestion ledger are removed **before ranking**, so the four-hour safety
margin does not make journal papers accumulate or overwhelm the arXiv pool.
Existing daily archives bootstrap the ledger conservatively on the first run.
The separate `recommendation-history.json` still controls the 7-day delivered
recommendation cooldown; ingestion history and recommendation history serve
different purposes.

The production job remains at 22:00 UTC. At that time it is before the next
20:00 Eastern arXiv announcement, so the visible arXiv feed and the completed
Crossref literature day stay aligned. The ±2 h overlap catches ordinary
boundary/visibility jitter near 20:00 ET without reverting to a multi-day journal
candidate pool. It is a practical safety margin rather than a guarantee against
arbitrarily long Crossref indexing delays. The per-journal result cap remains
`CROSSREF_ROWS_PER_JOURNAL=100`; raise it (up to 1000) if a single busy journal
exceeds that cap. Source outages are still logged and do not stop arXiv
recommendations. No fixed journal quota is imposed.

After the unchanged embedding/MMR ranking, V3 prefers candidates outside a
**7-day recommendation cooldown** (`RECOMMENDATION_COOLDOWN_DAYS=7`). A paper
recommended September 29 becomes eligible normally on October 6. Same-day reruns
also consult history. DOI case/URL prefixes, arXiv revisions and normalized titles
are matched across sources. If too few eligible candidates remain, the highest
ranked recent papers fill the remaining slots, clearly labeled **Repeat highlight**
with the previous date in both email and the archive. Previously recommended
papers outside the cooldown are labeled **Revisit**. Scores and ranking within
each tier are unchanged. `0` disables cooldown priority but keeps repeat labels;
`MAX_PAPER_NUM=-1` still selects all candidates.

Only selected papers from a successful email send are added to the atomic ledger
at `SITE_OUTPUT_DIR/data/recommendation-history.json`. Merely fetching/ranking a
paper, or failing before/during SMTP delivery, does not consume its cooldown.
Archive generation now follows successful email delivery. The ledger works even
with `PUBLISH_SITE=false`; retain/persist this data directory between local runs.
GitHub Actions commits it alongside the archive and serializes daily runs.
Existing `data/daily/*.json` files bootstrap recommendation history without schema
migration; those old selections are treated as previously recommended (they are
not independent proof of email delivery). Same-day ledger entries are merged,
even though the daily archive snapshot remains the latest run for that date.
An invalid durable ledger fails the run rather than silently resetting history.

As with any SMTP + Git commit workflow, acceptance by SMTP and persistence cannot
be one atomic transaction. A runner crash after sending or a failed Git push can
still leave delivered papers unrecorded; inspect delivery before retrying such a
run. This is not an exactly-once email guarantee.

`CROSSREF_LOOKBACK_DAYS` is no longer used by the production workflow; the
Crossref window is fixed to one completed arXiv-clock day plus a ±2 h boundary overlap.
`RECOMMENDATION_COOLDOWN_DAYS` remains configurable and defaults to 7 days.
V2 comparison code/configuration is unaffected.

Offline regression checks (no SMTP, LLM downloads, or live feeds):

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -m py_compile *.py
node --check site/assets/app.js
```

### Branch layout for this fork

- `main`: production V3, including the research archive and recommendation ledger.
- `v2-backup`: preserved V2 snapshot; not a production or scheduled-run branch.
- `own_branch`: personal work, preserved unchanged.
- `upstream`: unmodified snapshot of `TideDra/zotero-arxiv-daily`'s `main`.

The daily workflow on the default branch runs at 22:00 UTC, checks out `main`,
and commits archive updates back to `main`. GitHub Pages deploys that archive
after a successful daily run. Crossref follows the completed arXiv-clock day
with a ±2 h boundary overlap filtered by the ingestion ledger; the 7-day
recommendation cooldown remains configurable.

`upstream` was synced on 2026-09-30 to commit
`1752039ad2ec41a97ea8f5e65b0838e995b8c461`. It is a clean reference for reviewing
upstream changes, not an automatic merge into production. Future syncs should
move only `upstream`; review and test selected changes before applying to `main`.

Keep `v2-backup`, `own_branch`, and `upstream` non-default. Their historical or
upstream workflows are retained faithfully but should not be manually dispatched
for production. No extra email run is required for branch housekeeping.
